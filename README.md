🚴‍♂️ Bike Purchase Behaviour Analysis Dashboard

# 📊 A Data Analytics Project Using Excel

This project explores customer demographics and behavioral patterns that influence bike purchasing decisions. The dataset was obtained online from an open-source sample data repository, and I transformed it into an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel.

The goal of this project is to understand who buys bikes, what influences purchasing decisions, and how demographic factors relate to buying behavior.
